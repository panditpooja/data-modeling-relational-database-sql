# Relational Database Design Project – Phase 1

This project showcases a complete relational database design workflow for a conceptual business idea, created as part of *INFO 579: SQL/NoSQL Databases for Data and Information Sciences*. It demonstrates the process of translating business requirements into a database schema, along with sample data and entity-relationship diagrams.

## 📖 Overview
The project involved:
- **Requirements Analysis**: Documenting business needs and identifying entities, attributes, and relationships.  
- **Conceptual Modeling**: Designing an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) using Crow’s Foot notation.  
- **Physical Modeling**: Creating a physical database schema based on the conceptual model.  
- **Sample Data Creation**: Generating realistic data to populate the designed database.  

This exercise provided hands-on experience in **data modeling**, **schema design**, and preparing a database for implementation.
